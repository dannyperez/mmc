## Mandriva Management Console ##

This repository is the place where you will find **Mandriva Directory Server** and **Mandriva Pulse** projects.
Both share the same framework: **Mandriva Management Console**, this is why you have to install the core part first.

Read INSTALL files of each project for installation instructions.

###Â Note ###

This project is not maintained anymore. A fork is born from the ashes of Pulse component named Nytrio. You can check it out at [nytrio.com](https://nytrio.com)
